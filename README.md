# Medical Text Mining for Disease Detection using NLP

## Project Overview
This project applies advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to the field of healthcare to enhance disease detection and diagnosis using clinical texts. By automating the extraction of diagnostic information from electronic health records (EHRs) and other clinical documents, this project aims to improve healthcare outcomes and reduce costs. The repository includes code, datasets, and documentation for building and evaluating NLP models capable of identifying and classifying medical information.

## Key Features
**Disease Detection Model**: Identifies diseases from clinical text data.
**Information Classification Model**: Classifies texts into categories such as symptoms, treatments, and outcomes.
**Jupyter Notebook Integration**: Includes interactive notebooks to demonstrate and use the models.
**BERT Model Integration**: Utilizes the BERT model for enhancing the context understanding of medical texts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, pytorch, transformers

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   
2. Install required Python packages:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

### Using the Models
To use the models, navigate to the cloned directory and launch Jupyter Notebook:

cd your-repository-name
jupyter notebook

Open the `Disease_Detection_Notebook.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions to run the models.

## Dataset
This project uses a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle, which includes a wide variety of medical texts, ranging from journal articles to clinical notes and research papers. The data is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets to ensure robust model training and evaluation.

## Models and Performance
- **Disease Detection Model**: Achieves a precision of 24% and an F1-score of 20%, indicating its early stage of development.
- **Information Classification Model**: Shows a precision of 78%, a recall of 83%, and an F1-score of 79%, demonstrating strong performance in categorizing medical texts.
